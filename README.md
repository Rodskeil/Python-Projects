print("Hello World")

Some one said once, that if you don't start your code with the Hello World, will bring to you bad lucky.

So here you will find some begginer or JR. type of code, with a lot to learn and a lot of hunger of learning, preparing my self to became a developer with python as my main language,

Feel free to fork it or even clone in your computer.

Thanks and welcome
